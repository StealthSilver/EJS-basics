Templating

EJS (Embedded JS templates)

EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JS

if there are multiple pages with same HTMl markup we use templating.
this is like a blueprint

other tools are handlebars

o1.js 
npm i ejs

we need not require EJS in js file as Express by default requires it

also all the HTMl templetes must be in the views directory
